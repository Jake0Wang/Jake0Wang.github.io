Would you like to learn how to play?\u201d My kids replied with an enthusiastic \u201cYes!\u201d So, he made a deal with them. The deal was if they tried real hard and learned all their new words really well, he would teach them how to play. My children have been so excited about having a chance to play; I don\u2019t think they realize how hard they have worked or the fact they\u2019ve had no intention of giving up.

This test is one of the licensing tests required for teachers of Chinese as a Foreign Language in Minnesota. For a native speaker of Chinese, the licensing tests do not pose a serious challenge, but I am not a native speaker. Prior to meeting with Luke, I had already taken several years of Chinese at the university level. I had also been accepted to the licensing program at the University of Minnesota for teaching Chinese, and I had passed the first subtest. Nonetheless, subtest 2 was a daunting challenge for me because it required me to speak and write spontaneously, so I decided to hire a tutor to help me.',a.createElement("br",null),a.createElement("br",null),'I am glad I chose Luke to help me with this task. He understood what I needed, and he was flexible enough to let me go at my own pace and adapt to what I wanted to work on.
